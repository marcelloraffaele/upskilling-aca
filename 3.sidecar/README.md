To add a sidecar container to an existing Azure Container App for troubleshooting, you need to update the app’s configuration to include the new sidecar container. This is typically done by exporting the current configuration, editing it to add the sidecar, and then updating the app using the Azure CLI.

Here’s how you can do it:

1. Export the current configuration:
```sh
az containerapp show --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --output yaml > containerapp.yaml
```

2. Edit `containerapp.yaml`:
- Under `template.containers`, add a new entry for your sidecar container. For example:
```yaml
    containers:
      - name: main-app
        image: <your-main-image>
        # ...existing config...
      - name: troubleshooting-sidecar
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do sleep 3600; done"]
        resources:
          cpu: 0.1
          memory: 0.1Gi
```

3. Update the container app with the new YAML:
```sh
az containerapp update --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group> --yaml containerapp.yaml
```

This will add the sidecar container (e.g., `busybox`) to your running app for troubleshooting purposes.
